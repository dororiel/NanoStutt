# NanoStutt - Advanced Stutter Audio Plugin

## Overview

NanoStutt is a sophisticated stutter/glitch audio plugin built with JUCE that provides intelligent, musical stuttering effects with weighted probability systems and advanced timing control.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Dual-Layer Architecture**
- **Regular Rate System**: Traditional stutter rates (1/4, 1/3, 1/6, 1/8, 1/12, 1/16, 1/24, 1/32)
- **Nano Rate System**: Fine-tuned fractional rates for micro-timing variations and pitch shifting effects

### 2. **Weighted Probability System**
- Each stutter rate has an adjustable probability weight (0.0 to 1.0)
- The system randomly selects rates based on weighted probabilities for musical variation
- **Dynamic Probabilistic Quantization**: Quantization units (1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32) are selected using weighted probabilities
- Real-time quantization switching allows adaptive timing contexts

### 3. **Pre-emptive Fade System**
- **Mid-point Decision Strategy**: Auto-stutter decisions are made at the middle of quantization intervals
- **1ms Crossfades**: Pre-emptive crossfades eliminate clicks at event boundaries
- **Sample-accurate Timing**: All fade transitions are precisely timed to avoid artifacts

### 4. **Dual Envelope Architecture**
- **Nano Envelope**: Controls internal loop behavior within stutter events
- **Macro Envelope**: Controls overall stutter event shape and duration
- **Independent Shape Control**: Each envelope has gate, shape, and smooth parameters

## Current Features

### Auto Stutter System
- **Auto Stutter Toggle**: Enable/disable automatic stutter triggering
- **Stutter Chance**: Global probability (0.0-1.0) for stutter events to occur
- **Reverse Chance**: Probability (0.0-1.0) that stutter events will reverse after first repeat cycle
- **Quantization Selection**: Choose timing resolution (1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 notes)
- **Weighted Rate Selection**: Each rate has individual probability settings
- **Probabilistic Quantization**: Each quantization unit (1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32) has adjustable probability weights
- **Dynamic Quantization Switching**: System automatically selects next quantization unit based on weighted probabilities

### Manual Stutter Controls
- **Manual Stutter Button**: Instant stutter trigger
- **Rate-specific Buttons**: Direct access to specific stutter rates (4, 3, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32)

### Nano System
- **Nano Blend**: Mix between repeat mode and nano fractional rates (0.0-1.0)
- **Nano Tune**: Global tuning adjustment for nano rates (0.75x - 2.0x)
- **12 Nano Rate Slots**: Individual probability controls for micro-timing variations
- **Fractional Ratios**: Precise timing ratios (1.0, 15/16, 5/6, 4/5, 3/4, 2/3, 3/5, 0.5, etc.)

### Envelope Controls

#### Nano Envelope (Internal Loop Control)
- **Nano Gate**: Loop duration control (0.0-1.0)
- **Nano Shape**: Loop envelope curve (0.0-1.0)
- **Nano Smooth**: Crossfade between loop repetitions (0.0-1.0) - eliminates internal clicks

#### Macro Envelope (Event-level Control)
- **Macro Gate**: Overall event duration (0.0-1.0)
- **Macro Shape**: Event envelope curve (0.0-1.0)
- **Macro Smooth**: Event boundary smoothing (0.0-1.0)

### Mix Modes
- **Gate Mode**: Traditional gated stutter with silence gaps
- **Insert Mode**: Stutters inserted without replacing original audio
- **Mix Mode**: Blend between dry and stuttered signals

### Audio Processing
- **Waveshaping**: Built-in waveshaping with multiple algorithms (None, Soft Clip, Tanh, Hard Clip, Tube, Asymmetric)
- **Waveshape Intensity**: Control intensity of waveshaping effect (0.0-1.0, bypassed at 0)

### User Interface
- **Grid-based Layout**: Modern responsive layout using JUCE Grid system
- **Left Panel**: Envelope controls (Macro/Nano) + utility controls (Nano Tune, Waveshaper, Timing Offset)
- **Center Panel**: Rate probability sliders (regular rates → nano rates → auto toggle → quantization)
- **Right Panel**: Chance, Repeat/Nano blend, Reverse controls + manual stutter button
- **Optimized Spacing**: Expanded nano section with improved text box and slider proportions

### Visual Feedback
- **Stutter Visualizer**: Real-time waveform display of current stutter buffer contents

### Timing Controls
- **Timing Offset**: Manual timing offset parameter (-100ms to +100ms) for master track delay compensation in Ableton Live

### Reverse Playback System
- **Intelligent Reverse Logic**: When reverse is triggered, the first repeat cycle plays forward, then subsequent cycles play in reverse
- **Seamless Integration**: Reverse playback works with all stutter rates, quantization units, and envelope settings
- **Per-Event Decision**: Each stutter event independently decides whether to reverse based on probability
- **Example**: For a 1/8th quantization with 1/16th repeat rate marked for reverse:
  - 1st 1/16th cycle: Forward playback
  - 2nd 1/16th cycle onward: Reverse playback until stutter event ends

## Technical Architecture

### Core Processing
- **Sample-accurate Buffer Management**: Precise timing control for all operations
- **Stereo Processing**: Full stereo support with proper channel handling
- **Host Sync**: Automatic synchronization to DAW tempo and timing

### Fade System Implementation
- **Pre-emptive Fades**: 1ms crossfades scheduled before event boundaries
- **Multiple Fade Types**:
  - Dry to Wet (stutter event start)
  - Wet to Dry (stutter event end)
  - Wet to Silence (gated events)
  - Post-silence to Dry (after gated events)

### State Management
- **Real-time Safe Parameter Access**: Cached parameters for audio thread safety
- **Dynamic Quantization**: Adaptive timing based on current musical context with probabilistic selection
- **Lookahead Processing**: Mid-point decisions enable artifact-free transitions
- **Quantization Probability Engine**: Weighted selection system for adaptive timing resolution
